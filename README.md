##What's the game about
You all know about Frogger, don't you?
I won't go into the story, this will be just a small notice on the
pecularities of the vectrex version.

## Play area

Due to problems of clipping vectors the play area is not
the same as the area where objects (logs, cars etc) may move to, it
is smaller.
The play area is marked by a couple of lines.
a. the home area,
b. the middle area
and
c. the starting line (timer)

The frog may only be between the thus marked area. If you somehow happen to
move (or be moved) outside, frog will drop of the worlds edge and
be dead.
If anyone draws an overlay, the edges should be in none transparent colors,
so that one doesn't see more than the play area.

## Features

Many known features of the arcade frogger are implemented,
as there are:
* girls
* flies in home
* crocodile in home
* crocodile in river
* otter in river
* snakes on middle band
* snake on logs

known not implemented features:
* two snakes on one log
* frog may not stand on a closed crocodile mouth

* scoring, level, life information is not allways seen
* it is not seen whether frog carries the girl
* no intermission on level complete where frogs in home twinkle
* some intermissions not available in the arcade
* scoring differs from arcade
* level construction differs from arcade

## How to play
* Move the frog with the joystick.
* You can pause the game while playing by pressing button4,
  to unpause any other button...
* There are sometimes intermissions, like
-frog reached home
-new frog awarded
-new highscore
... and a few others
These will only be shortly displayed, no way to pause them.
But if they still take to long, you can press any button to stop those
intermissions immediately and go on.
* Scoring is only updated when the score is displayed.
* No score is displayed while playing, nor during intermissions.
* You can only view scoring, level and life stati while in pause mode.
* New frogs are awarded every 10,000 points, but only at a homereach
or at the end of a level.

BTW. All Levels are possible to complete! (though some are really tough)
